    <p><b><h3>I started working right after some months of my 12th result due to some family financial issues.I didn't knew at that time 
        that it will turn out to be such a good decision.But i also didn't knew that it was just the start of my story... So,Initially i worked with a Hospital named 
        Lifeline Hospital  for about 5-6 months.People were good there.They considered me a child so acted accordingly.Fast forward i was fed up with 
        limited mindset of those collegues so i was actively searching for new oppurtunities...

    <P><b><h3>In april of  2022, i started working with a NGO  named Initiators Of Change.Its been more  than a year i'm strongly connected with 
        it now...This new place came with new oppurtunities,people with right & progressive mindset,some really good humans,and a lot of love from my students,
        Last year completely turned the coin of life my upside down...at least i think....Rab mehar kare.........
